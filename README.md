### Hey 👋

I’m **Talha** — an **AI / Deep Learning software engineer** with a strong focus on **AI-Driven systems with scalable backend architecture, and high performant systems engineering**.

I’m passionate about **building intelligent systems end-to-end**: Developing and experimenting with AI models to solve problems, integrating them into robust systems, deploying at scale, optimizing for performance and evolving over time. I'm especially drawn at the intersection of **AI-engineering and backend-architecture**, and how it's applied to the real-world. I enjoy workign across the stack from model logic to backend infrastructure on performance-critical system and in domains like financial markets.

### What I Focus On

- 🧠 **AI / Deep Learning & GenAI** — Model architecture, evaluation, applied NLP, and understanding how models improve real systems.
- ⚙️ **Backend & Software Architecture** — Designing scalable APIs, data pipelines, and AI-driven workflows in production.
- ⚡ **High-Performance Systems** — Low-latency design, high throughput, and extensive observability.
- ☁️ **Cloud & Deployment**  
  Building and deploying prod-ready AI systems on AWS with scalability and reliability in mind.
- 📊 **Finance + AI**
  Applied AI & DeepLearning while maintaingin performance to financial systems.
I care deeply about **clean code, clear abstractions, and thoughtful design trade-offs**.

### What I’m Currently Working On

- **Deep Learning & GenAI specialization (in progress)**  
  Strengthening fundamentals in neural networks, modern architectures, and optimization, with emphasis on practical system integration and not just theory.
- **AWS Certification (in progress)**  
  Currently working on AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner & Certified AI Practitioner.
- **Building and refining backend systems**  
  Applying performance-first and low-latency & correctness driven design principles to real projects.

### Selected Projects

- **FlashMatch — High-Performance Stock Matching Engine**  
  *C++20 · gRPC · Kafka · Prometheus*  
  A sub-15µs Matching Engine. Designed to explore **performance engineering, and Quant finance**.
- **Find Your Roof — Scalable Full-Stack Platform**  
  *NestJS · MySQL · AWS S3 · React*  
  A full stack application for connecting homeless people to NGO. Worked on a Backend-centric architecture with stateless auth, database-level filtering, and horizontal scalability.
- **Machine Learning & NLP Projects**  
  Built a student performance risk classifier using Deep Learning, achieving 83.3% validation accuracy and 0.843 macro-F1.
- **Doccomment-Tags (Neovim Plugin)**  
  Authored and shipped a Open-source Lua plugin for Tree-sitter that highlights doc tags (@param/@return/@brief) with configurable tag sets and zero dependencies across C/C++/Java..
Each project README explains **why it exists, architectural decisions, trade-offs, current status, and future work**.

### Engineering Philosophy
- Treat AI as a **system component**, not a black box  
- Build systems that are **simple, correct, and observable systems**
- Optimize based on **measurement**, not assumptions
- Write code others can read, test, and extend
- Be honest about limitations and what’s next

Outside of engineering, I enjoy the gym & boxing, reading, and spending time with family.

If you’re working on **AI-enabled systems, backend platforms, or performance-critical software**, I’d be happy to connect.
